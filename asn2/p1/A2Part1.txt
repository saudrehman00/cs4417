**************Q1*****************
Some differences to note are that minilm seems to prefer longer queries relative to glove in this example. Another differnce is glove seems to prefer tagging people where minilm seems to prefer providing hyperlinks. I do not see any logical reason for either to prefer one over the other but that is in this limited sample.
GloVe is based on co-occurrence statistics, which means that it is more focused on the frequency of words in a document or corpus, rather than their actual meaning. This makes it particularly effective for keyword-based queries, where the goal is to find documents that contain specific words or phrases. In contrast, MiniLM is more focused on capturing the meaning of words and phrases in context. This allows it to understand the semantics of a query and return results that are more relevant to the user's intent, even if the exact words in the query are not present in the document. This makes MiniLM more effective for natural language queries, where users might express their search intent using different words or phrases. 

**************Q2*****************
After trying the query "I am looking for a job" on Twitter's search page, I do not think that Twitter is using a semantic search technique like the ones I tried. This is because the search results on Twitter are primarily based on keywords and hashtags used in tweets, rather than semantic understanding of the query. Twitter's search algorithm is designed to identify tweets that contain exact or related terms from the query, and display them in chronological order based on tweet recency and user engagement. However, Twitter might be using some natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve the relevance of the search results by understanding the context of the query and tweets.
