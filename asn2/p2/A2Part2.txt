My GPT-2 Story:
---------------
In a land far away, in a place far, far away from us, there is no place for us to go.

We have no place to go, and we will not go. We have no way out. We will not be able to find a way out of this place. We do not know where we are going. We don't know what to do with ourselves. We know that we are in this place, and that we will be there for a long time to come. We are going to be here for a very long time, and it is going to take us many, many years to come back to this place again. It will take us a lot of time to get back to where we came from, and then we will have to go back to what we were before. It is not going to happen overnight. It may take a while, but it will be worth it.
